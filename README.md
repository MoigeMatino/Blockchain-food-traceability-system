# Farm2Table - Food Supplychain Traceability Application

This is a blockchain-based application built with Hyperledger Fabric that enables traceability of food items on the supply chain. The goal of this application is to ensure that consumers can trust the origin and quality of the food they purchase by providing a transparent and immutable record of its journey from **farm to table**.

## How it works

The Food Traceability Blockchain is designed to capture and store important data points at each step of the food supply chain, including the farm, distributor, retailer, and specifics of the food item. This data includes information about the origin, production, handling, and transportation of the food item, as well as any quality control checks or certifications it has received. 

Each data point is recorded on the blockchain as a transaction, creating an auditable trail that can be traced back to the source. This allows consumers to verify the authenticity and safety of the food they purchase by scanning a QR code on the packaging and accessing the blockchain record.

## Benefits

The Food Traceability Blockchain offers several benefits over traditional supply chain tracking methods, including:

- Increased transparency: Consumers can easily access detailed information about the food they purchase, including where it was grown, processed, and transported.
- Improved safety: The blockchain record ensures that food safety standards are being met at every step of the supply chain, reducing the risk of contamination and foodborne illness.
- Reduced fraud: The immutable nature of the blockchain makes it difficult for bad actors to tamper with or falsify the data, providing greater protection against fraud.
